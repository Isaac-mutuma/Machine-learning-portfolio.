                   Customer Insurance/Churn Analysis and Prediction using Logistic Regression
This project aims to perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a dataset containing customer information and their history with a bank, and use that information to build a logistic regression model to predict customer churn.

Data Preprocessing
The data was preprocessed by cleaning and transforming it, including removing missing or duplicate values, 

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
EDA was performed on the dataset to gain insights into the relationships between features and the target variable (insurance/churn). This involved creating visualizations, such as histograms, bar plots, and scatter plots, to explore the distributions and relationships of the features.

Model Development
A logistic regression model was built to predict customer insurance/churn based on the information in the dataset. The model was trained and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1 score.


Conclusion
In conclusion, this project has shown the effectiveness of using logistic regression for predicting customer insurance/churn based on customer information and history. The results of this analysis can be used by the bank to develop strategies for retaining customers and preventing them from leaving.

Libraries used

Files included
churn_analysis.ipynb and insurance.ipynb: Jupyter notebook containing the code for data preprocessing, EDA, and logistic regression model development and evaluation.
churn_data.csv and Insurance.csv: The dataset used in this analysis.
README.md: This file, which provides an overview of the project.

Requirements
The following libraries are required to run the code in churn_analysis.ipynb:
numpy
pandas
matplotlib
seaborn
scikit-learn


Usage
To run the code in churn_analysis.ipynb, make sure the required libraries are installed and the dataset is in the same directory as the Jupyter notebook. The code can then be executed by running each cell in sequence.
